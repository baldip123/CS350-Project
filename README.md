# CS350-Project
1. The main is file Interpreter.oz.
2. It \inserts other files in the directory.
3. We provide a file called SingleFile.oz in which no inserts have to be performed to make sure that there are no compilation issues,
4. We use unify from the 2015-16 offering of the course as we thought the provided unify has certain errors. https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/satyadev/fall15/#sec-4
5. Note that during pattern matching we assume that the record will have all values as different identifiers, i.e. in case X of label(f1:x1 f2:x2.....fn:xn), we assume
   x1..xn are distinct.
   Also we assume that formal params in function defintion are distinct as well.
6. To see how to run , please have a look at the testcases provided at the bottom of the file Interpreter.oz.

THANKS, IT WAS A WONDERFUL PROJECT TO IMPLEMENT!!.
